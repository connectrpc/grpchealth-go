  // the service's serving status changes.

  // If the requested service is unknown when the call is received, the
  // server will send a message setting the serving status to
  // SERVICE_UNKNOWN but will *not* terminate the call.  If at some
  // future point, the serving status of the service becomes known, the
  // server will send a new message with the service's serving status.
  //
  // If the call terminates with status UNIMPLEMENTED, then clients
  // should assume this method is not supported and should not retry the
  // call.  If the call terminates with any other status (including OK),
  // clients should retry the call with appropriate exponential backoff.
